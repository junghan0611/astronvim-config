# Practicalli Astro Configuration

Clojure development and more with [Neovim 0.10.x](https://neovim.org/) and [AstroNvim version 4](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)

**Using Neovim 0.11 with this configuration may result in treesitter and other errors/warnings**.  [Practicalli nvim-astro5](https://github.com/practicalli/nvim-astro5) is under development to better support Neovim 0.11 and AstroNvim v5.

> [Practicalli Neovim](https://practical.li/neovim/) describes the Clojure REPL workflow, rich Git and GitHub clients and easy management of plugins and tools using this configuration.


## 🛠️ Installation

- [Kitty Terminal](https://practical.li/engineering-playbook/command-line/kitty-terminal/)
- [Install Neovim and supporting tools](https://practical.li/neovim/install/neovim/)
- [Clojure install](https://practical.li/clojure/install/)

Clone the Practicalli Astro repository (create a fork if customisation desired)

```shell
git clone git@github.com:practicalli/astro $HOME/.config/nvim
```

Run `nvim` command and wait for all plugins to update

```shell
nvim
```

### Multiple Neovim configs

Clone to `$HOME/.config/astronvim` if there is an existing neovim configuration and use the `NVIM_APPNAME=astronvim nvim` command to start Neovim with AstroNvim configuration

```shell
git clone git@github.com:practicalli/astro $HOME/.config/nvim-astro
```

Create a shell alias to run the new configuration, e.g. in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` (or a `shell-aliases` file that each shell rc file sources)

```config
alias astro="NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-astro nvim"
```

Load the alias into the current shell (or open a new shell)

```shell
source shell-aliases
```

Run `astro` and allow neovim packages to be installed and Treesitter language parsers to compile.

```shell
astro
```

## Configuration

The configuration is based on the AstroNvim template config.  Changes to existing file have been kept to a minimum, except for `lua/community.lua` which has additional plugins from the AstroNvim Community repository.

`lua/plugins/example-config.lua` shows how to modify and extend the AstroNvim configuration.  This config is not loaded by defult.

Create your own `lua/plugins/user-name.lua` file to:

- override default plugin configuration
- add new plugins (or create a new file for a plugin to make them easier to be optional) or by customising the `lua/plugins/user.lua` file.

`lua/plugins/user-practicalli.lua` is an example of a user configuration that adds plugins and overrides plugin options.

> Lua files in the `lua/plugins` directory are loaded in alphabetical order so plugin overrides should be the last file to load, e.g `lua/plugins/user-*`


### Clojure LSP

Mason is used to install LSP servers, format & lint tools.  [Mason Registry](https://mason-registry.dev/registry/list) maintains a list of the latest release for each tool (automatically updated).

Practicalli Astro can be configured to use a locally installed Clojure LSP server (using the [instructions for your operating system](https://clojure-lsp.io/installation/)).  A commented configuration example is included in [lua/plugins/user-practicalli.lua](https://github.com/practicalli/astro/blob/main/lua/plugins/user-practicalli.lua).
